                    Our demo meeting for semester 2 is <strong>next Wednesday</strong> (5th of August)! <br><br>

                    It's from <strong>6 - 8 pm</strong> with a 15-minute break in the middle. During the break, there'll be 
                    <strong>Free Pizza!</strong> Vegetarian options and other refreshments will also be available. <br><br>
                    And, if you'd like to speak, you can! Let us know if you're keen and we'll give you something easy to talk about.
                    Or a hard one, if you're a masochist. <br><br>
