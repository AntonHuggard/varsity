                <p>Hello Friends!<br><br>
                    Now that Covid has been stopped and the University has stopped being a big nerd, we're meeting on campus again!<br>
                    Zoom wasn't a hit. Turns out you can't really practice public speaking from your bedroom. One 
                    slightly interesting thing that happened was that we had a guest join us from London. No idea why. <br>
                    Join us in the OGGB, room 260-205 from 6-8pm for some jolly good fun.<br>

                    Our demo meeting for semester 2 is <strong>next Wednesday</strong> (5th of August)! <br><br>

                    It's from <strong>6 - 8 pm</strong> with a 15-minute break in the middle. During the break, there'll be 
                    <strong>Free Pizza!</strong> Vegetarian options and other refreshments will also be available. <br><br>
                    And, if you'd like to speak, you can! Let us know if you're keen and we'll give you something easy to talk about.
                    Or a hard one, if you're a masochist. <br><br>

                    Join us in the <strong>East-Wing of the Clock Tower, room 119-G30!</strong>
                    (here are some helpful maps)
