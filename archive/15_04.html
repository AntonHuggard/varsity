            Last week, we had a meeting which drew the beginning of Georgia’s speech history at Varsity and the end of Vicky’s 
            novice speech giving.
            Georgia gave a great speech of herself (tradition of any Icebreaker) and Vicky gave a meaningful and moving speech about 
            her struggle with <em>Geiteskrankheit</em>.

        <p style = "text-align: center;">
            <em>The end marks a new beginning, so Varsity would like to congratulate:</em><br><br>

            <strong>VICKY LING</strong><br><br>

            <em>for completing her CC manual and earning the title of Competent Communicator.</em><br><br>

            As some of you may know, Kaala (our VP-Ed) has fled our country and will not be back till July, thus a survival of the 
            fittest election took place to determine who will take her place as the temporary VP-Ed. Swords were drawn and blood was 
            shed, and from it came the victor.<br><br>

            <em>Varsity would like to congratulate the new temp. VP-Ed:</em><br><br>

            <strong>NETHMIE GALLA</strong><br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            A lot of congratulations for one night. So if you have missed the night, then please congratulate the two on their achievements 
            as well as cry over the fact that you have missed out on Swiss chocolate and Polish fudge.

        For all of you who didn’t know, our lovely president and toastmaster of the year: Karl, went to the Division H – International 
        Speech Contest at the Fickling Convention Centre on Saturday.<br><br>

        He battled through the minutes with the stories of school and university and came out filled with blood, sweat and tears. Okay, 
        not tears because he’s the president. The president does not shed a tear.<br><br>
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 50px; color:gray">
        Karl battled like Maverick and had the sweetest moves but the judges did not agree with his daredevil ways<br>
        -Natalia
    </p>
    <p>
        Varsity would like to congratulate and acknowledge Karl for getting this far! And also for Natalia, Sonny and Vicky for going and 
        supporting him.
