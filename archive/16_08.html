                Good Evening my fellow members!<br><br>
The tabletopic competition is fast approaching and Varsity has decided to join forces with Biztalk to try and get you prepared for the oncoming competition. Not only is it the perfect opportunity to hone your own skills, but to observe your fellow toastmasters and those from another club.<br><br>

If you have any dietary requirements or questions drop us a comment on the facebook event or email us (Email can be found in the contact section).<br><br>
Iâ€™ll see you all there!
            </p>
