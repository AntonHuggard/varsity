        <p>Congratulations are in order for our current president Karl Waters, who has managed to trudge his way through the Area Contest taking home the gold.<br><br>

            For those of you who have no idea what it is, it is a head to head with the finest speakers in our zone, which ended in only the very best being pitted against each other.<br><br>
            
            So not only has Karl killed people at our club with words to get there, he also managed to slaughter the other speakers at the Area Contest without a sweat or stutter. Finally, coming out supreme as the most ultimate speaker of all time (in our zone).<br><br>

            CONGRATULATIONS PRESIDENT KARL<br><br>
