            <h2>MEMBERSHIP</h2>   
            <p>
                So you want to join us? Here are some quick details how you can do that and what you need to know!<br><br>

<strong>The important stuff</strong><br><br>
To join the club, new members will need to pay an initiation fee ($20) on top of the actual membership fee ($80). But don’t worry, it’s only a one-off fee so your first payment will be $120 and once you’re in the system all subsequent fees will be $80.<br><br>

Membership lasts for one semester.<br><br>

The membership fee is paid to us in New Zealand dollars. If you go to the Toastmasters International website, it says US dollars, but because we are not in the US, it doesn’t apply to you!<br><br>

<strong>Process</strong><br><br>
For more details and to begin the process of joining, contact us via our email (with the subject: Attn: VP-Membership) or come to our meeting and talk with our Vice President of Membership!<br><br>
