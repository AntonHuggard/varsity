            <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
            <p>
<strong>Who are we?</strong><br>
We are a Toastmasters club.<br>
You can call us an oratory hub.<br>
Once every week,<br>
We gather to speak<br>
And afterwards grab some grub.<br><br>

<strong>Where are we?</strong><br>
Our meetings occur in the Owen Glen<br>
But don’t worry, you don’t need to flee!<br>
We'll be waiting in Room 260-040c<br>
So come along and have fun.<br><br>

<strong>What are we like?</strong><br>
Students, staff, and alumni,<br>
A monk, a priest and a rabbi,<br>
You needn’t fear<br>
We’ve got them all here<br>
So you’ll fit right in when you come by<br>
<br>
