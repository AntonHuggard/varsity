    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <div class = "FAQ">
        <h3>When and where do you meet?</h3>
        <p>We meet every Wednesday from 6pm to 8pm at the University of Auckland. Meetings are currently held: <span id="about_meeting_location"></span> <br><br>Meetings generally don't happen for a few weeks around Christmas. If there's nothing on posted here or on our facebook page, send us an email to find out what's going on.</p>
        <h3>How much does it cost to join?</h3>
        <p>If you're new, it's ${{ cost_new_members }}. After that, it's ${{ cost_ongoing }} per semester. Being a guest is free though. Further information is on the <a href='membership'>Membership</a> section of this website.</p>
        <h3>What's the difference between Biztalk and Varsity?</h3>
        <p>Varsity is Auckland University's original Toastmasters club. We were so popular, Biztalk had to be created to ensure everyone had a chance to speak. Biztalk has its meetings on Monday and they take themselves very seriously</p>
        <h3>Why should I join <em>this</em> club?</h3>
        <p>Because we're fast and loose. If you're interested in listening to some squares talk about conflict resolution in the work place or whatever, look elsewhere. Sometimes we forget who was meant to be evaluating. Doesn't matter. Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.</p>
        <h3>What does 'Varsity' mean?</h3>
        <p>You uncultured swine! It refers to <em>university</em>.</p>
        <h3>I'm not a student. Can I still join?</h3>
        <p>Yes.</p>
        <h3>What's Toastmasters?</h3>
        <p>It's a bit like the illuminati. Only for public speaking. It's an international organisation that's over 100 years old (something like that. I can't be bothered looking it up) to help people get better at public speaking.</p>
