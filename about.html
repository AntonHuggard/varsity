            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <div class = "FAQ">
                <h3>What's the difference between Biztalk and Varsity?</h3>
                <p>Varsity is Auckland University's original Toastmasters club. We were so popular, Biztalk had to be created to ensure everyone had a chance to speak. They are two independent clubs, run and attended by different people.</p>
                <h3>Why should I join <em>this</em> club?</h3>
                <p>Because we're fast and loose. If you're interested in listening to some squares talk about conflict resoltuion in the work place or whatever, look elsewhere.</p>
                <h3>What does 'Varsity' mean?</h3>
                <p>You uncultured swine! It refers to <em>university</em>. The club is called this because it's a toastmasters club at a <em>varsity</em></p>
