<strong>Who are we?</strong><br>

Once every week,<br>
We gather to speak<br>
And afterwards grab some grub.<br><br>
<!--

Our meetings occur in Arts 1<br>
But don’t worry, you don’t need to run!<br>
Room 206-210<br>
(Special meetings in Owen Glen),<br>
So come along and have fun.<br> -->

<strong>What are we like?</strong><br>
Students, staff, and alumni,<br>
A monk, a priest and a rabbi,<br>
You needn’t fear<br>

                <h3>What's the difference between Biztalk and Varsity?</h3>
                <p>Varsity is Auckland University's original Toastmasters club. We were so popular, Biztalk had to be created to ensure everyone had a chance to speak. Biztalk has its meetings on Monday and they take themselves very seriously</p>
                <h3>Why should I join <em>this</em> club?</h3>
                <p>Because we're fast and loose. If you're interested in listening to some squares talk about conflict resoltuion in the work place or whatever, look elsewhere. Sometimes we forget who was meant to be evaluating. Doesn't matter. Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.</p>
                <h3>What does 'Varsity' mean?</h3>
                <p>You uncultured swine! It refers to <em>university</em>.</p>
                <h3>I'm not a student. Can I still join?</h3>
                <p>Yes.</p>
