    Our demo meeting for semester 2 is <strong>next Wednesday</strong> (5th of August)! <br /><br />

    It's from <strong>6 - 8 pm</strong> with a 15-minute break in the middle. During the break, there'll be 
    <strong>Free Pizza!</strong> Vegetarian options and other refreshments will also be available. <br /><br />
    And, if you'd like to speak, you can! Let us know if you're keen and we'll give you something easy to talk about.
    Or a hard one, if you're a masochist. <br /><br />

    Join us in the <strong>East-Wing of the Clock Tower, room 119-G30!</strong>
    (here are some helpful maps)
