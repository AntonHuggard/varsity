I"<p>It’s the end of the year and that means we don’t have to keep going to toastmasters for much longer.
Firstly, you might want to note we’ve had a change in room since the last update. We’re still in OGGB, but on floor 2. Room 206.</p>

<p>For the last Varsity sesh of 2020, we’ll be having our annual festive hat meeting. 
Santa hats, reindeer antlers, christmassy wizard hats, the works.</p>

<p>As we always say; if it’s festive, put it on your head!</p>
