I"È<p>Hello Friends!</p>

<p>This Friday (the 15th), we are laying down our weapons to play some games with our rival club, Biztalk. Itâ€™s like how those soldiers played games on Chirstmas during the first World War. The university is still being a big nerd and not letting us go back to campus, so everything will be done online.</p>

<p>The zoom meeting link is still TBA, but hold onto your pants. Weâ€™ll post it on Facebook or something. If youâ€™re keen to join, make sure to get in contact somehow.</p>

<p>Oh yeah. This is also the first post to the new website. At this stage, we donâ€™t have a domain name and the website is still under construction but Iâ€™m working on it.</p>

<p>Wash your hands.</p>
