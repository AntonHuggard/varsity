I"ï<p>Ahoy!</p>

<p>We are having our demo meeting this Wednesday in the architecture building.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t know where that is? Fear not, gentle reader. Follow my directions and you will arrive
safe and sound:</p>

<p>Okay, first of all, walk past engineering building (the one with the red neon lights) and turn left
down that path. If you keep following that, youâ€™ll walk into the dance studies building.
Donâ€™t do that.
Turn to your right (so youâ€™re facing the church). March towards the big 1970s brick university building.</p>

<p>Go through the double doors. This opens into a weird little corridor - there are stairs at about 9 oâ€™clock.
Go through them. Go up to floor 5. Exit stairwell. I think there are lifts straight ahead of you.
Go forward and down the little corridor to your front/right. The room is then on the left.</p>

<p>If you manage that, congratulations! Youâ€™re definitely smart enough to get an Arts degree.</p>

<p>Join us in our very easy-to-find room from 6-8pm! :D</p>
