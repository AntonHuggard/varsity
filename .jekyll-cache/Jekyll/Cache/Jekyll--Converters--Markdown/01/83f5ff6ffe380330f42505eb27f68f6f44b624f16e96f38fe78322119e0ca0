I"¯<p>Ahoy!</p>

<p>We are having our demo meeting this Wednesday in the architecture building.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t know where that is? Fear not, gentle reader. Follow my directions and you will arrive
safe and sound:</p>

<p>Okay, first of all, walk past engineering building (the one with the red neon lights) and turn left
down that path. If you keep following that, youâ€™ll walk into the dance studies building.
Donâ€™t do that.</p>
