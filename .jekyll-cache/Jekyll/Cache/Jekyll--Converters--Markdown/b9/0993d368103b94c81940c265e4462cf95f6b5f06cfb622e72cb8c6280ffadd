I"ï<p>Howdy speech fans</p>

<p>Do you love a good speech? Me neither. But weâ€™re keeping the club going anyway.</p>

<p>We are meeting in the flesh again this Wednesday (the 10th of March) in Arts 1, room 314.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s nothing else to say. To be completely honest, Iâ€™m not sure this warranted a new post but I was asked to put something up so here we are. And I always hate the posts with barely any text because theyâ€™re such a waste of time and look weird on the home page. For the sake of completeness of the Varsity Chronicles, it might be worth mentioning that we gave up on Zoom over these last two short lockdowns. Zoom is dumb and a waste of time for this sort of thing.</p>

<p>On that merry note, I shall bid you good night.</p>
