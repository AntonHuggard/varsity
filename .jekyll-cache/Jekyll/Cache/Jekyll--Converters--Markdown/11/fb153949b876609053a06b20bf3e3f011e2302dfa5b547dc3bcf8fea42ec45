    For all of you who didn’t know, our lovely president and toastmaster of the year: Karl, went to the Division H – International 
    Speech Contest at the Fickling Convention Centre on Saturday.<br /><br />

    He battled through the minutes with the stories of school and university and came out filled with blood, sweat and tears. Okay, 
    not tears because he’s the president. The president does not shed a tear.<br /><br />

    Karl battled like Maverick and had the sweetest moves but the judges did not agree with his daredevil ways<br />

    supporting him.
