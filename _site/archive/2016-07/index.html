                Good Evening Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>

After a recent election I have acquired the executive powers over the website. Meaning two things; this is now the domain of the Webmaster, and I will be enforcing vast, wild and radical changes.<br><br>

Once we are again in the full swing of things, your Secretary (Gen) will be providing regular updates of the club . These will be accessible through the side bars provided.<br><br>

We will also be cataloging the very best speeches, not only as a way to preserve our clubs’ history but to allow new and current members a source to benchmark their own writing abilities against. This will also function as a guide to help you complete your CC manual and compliment the educationals, mentoring program and other resources on offer.<br><br>

If you have any questions do not hesitate to message us at the Varsity organisation facebook page or drop us a comment on the group.<br><br>

Kind Regards,
Webmaster
