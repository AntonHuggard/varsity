                “…and that government of the people, by the people, <br>for the people…” – A. Lincoln, 1863.
            </p>
<p>
It is commonly taken that this statement is an original line from Lincoln. Yet Lincoln had a copy of Theodore Parker’s addresses in which was said “Democracy is direct self-government, over all the people, by all the people, and for all the people”.<br><br>

Theodore Parker’s phrase comes from Webster who four years before him said “The people’s government, made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people”.<br><br>

Furthermore, Webster may have taken inspiration from President J.Monroe who a third of a century earlier uttered the same phraseology. Yet five hundred years before Monroe, Wyclif in a foreword to a translated bible said “This bible is for the government of the people, by the people, and for the people”. Yet again 400 years BC, Cleon spoke to Athens of a rule that is “of the people, by the people, and for the people”. And so on and on, into time immemorial….
