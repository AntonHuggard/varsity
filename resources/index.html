        <strong>The Resources Repository Blog Roll</strong><br><br>

        Welcome to the Varsity Resources page! Flop down to a chair and clap up a hot choc, this I going to be worth the while – and may be worth the speed dial!<br><br>
        
        We’re going to have a regular blog roll, filled to the crust with content on topics that range from how to break through your icebreaker like the Krasin, to how to vary up your vocal variety like a vivacious variety show fuelled on V.<br><br>
        
        At Varsity Toastmasters, as much as we love practicing public speaking, we love learning how to become greater speakers. Our mission is to raise the bar for public speaking – and rid the world of boring presentations.<br><br>
        
        Keep an eye on the roll – the Varsity headquarters is on battle stations!<br><br>
