We have been meeting back on campus for a while now, but I haven't bothered to update the website since Covid days...

Anyway, we're back on campus (and have been for a couple of months)! Join us in the OGGB, room 321.

It's a bit hard to find, so here are some instructions: 
1). When you step out of the lift go towards the doors near the stairs.
2). Open doors
3). Turn right and walk to the *very* back of the building. Right to the back.
4). Turn left and it's the second door you'll see on that back wall.
5). Open door
6). Close door and run away. Come back when you've got more confidence.
