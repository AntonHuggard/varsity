Ahoy!

We are having our demo meeting this Wednesday in the architecture building.

Don't know where that is? Fear not, gentle reader. Follow my directions and you will arrive
safe and sound:

Okay, first of all, walk past engineering building (the one with the red neon lights) and turn left
down that path. If you keep following that, you'll walk into the dance studies building.
Don't do that.
Turn to your right (so you're facing the church). March towards the big 1970s brick university building.

Go through the double doors. This opens into a weird little corridor - there are stairs at about 9 o'clock.
Go through them. Go up to floor 5. Exit stairwell. I think there are lifts straight ahead of you.
Go forward and down the little corridor to your front/right. The room is then on the left.

If you manage that, congratulations! You're definitely smart enough to get an Arts degree.

Join us in our very easy-to-find room from 6-8pm!
