It's the end of the year and that means we don't have to keep going to toastmasters for much longer.
Firstly, you might want to note we've had a change in room since the last update. We're still in OGGB, but on floor 2. Room 206.

For the last Varsity sesh of 2020, we'll be having our annual festive hat meeting. 
Santa hats, reindeer antlers, christmassy wizard hats, the works. 

As we always say; if it's festive, put it on your head!
