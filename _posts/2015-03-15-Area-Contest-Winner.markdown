Congratulations are in order for our current president Karl Waters, who has managed to trudge his way through the Area Contest taking home the gold.

For those of you who have no idea what it is, it is a head to head with the finest speakers in our zone, which ended in only the very best being pitted against each other.

So not only has Karl killed people at our club with words to get there, he also managed to slaughter the other speakers at the Area Contest without a sweat or stutter. Finally, coming out supreme as the most ultimate speaker of all time (in our zone).
