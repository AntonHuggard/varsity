<p>Hello Friends!<br><br>
Now that Covid has been stopped and the University has stopped being a big nerd, we're meeting on campus again!<br>
Zoom wasn't a hit. Turns out you can't really practice public speaking from your bedroom. One 
slightly interesting thing that happened was that we had a guest join us from London. No idea why. <br>
Join us in the OGGB, room 260-205 from 6-8pm for some jolly good fun.<br>
