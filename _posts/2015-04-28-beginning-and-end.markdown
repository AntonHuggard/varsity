    Last week, we had a meeting which drew the beginning of Georgia’s speech history at Varsity and the end of Vicky’s 
    novice speech giving.
    Georgia gave a great speech of herself (tradition of any Icebreaker) and Vicky gave a meaningful and moving speech about 
    her struggle with <em>Geiteskrankheit</em>.

    <em>The end marks a new beginning, so Varsity would like to congratulate:</em><br><br>

    <strong>VICKY LING</strong><br><br>

    <em>for completing her CC manual and earning the title of Competent Communicator.</em><br><br>

    As some of you may know, Kaala (our VP-Ed) has fled our country and will not be back till July, thus a survival of the 
    fittest election took place to determine who will take her place as the temporary VP-Ed. Swords were drawn and blood was 
    shed, and from it came the victor.<br><br>

    <em>Varsity would like to congratulate the new temp. VP-Ed:</em><br><br>

    <strong>NETHMIE GALLA</strong><br><br>
</p>
<p>
    A lot of congratulations for one night. So if you have missed the night, then please congratulate the two on their achievements 
    as well as cry over the fact that you have missed out on Swiss chocolate and Polish fudge.
